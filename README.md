# Scoop

Catches a stack trace when an app crashes unexpectedly.

Get releases here: https://github.com/TacoTheDank/Scoop/releases


### Fork info

This fork aims to further improve and maintain the app, as it seems to me that paphonb is finished with it.

Fork differences will be included in this README as they are made. You can also read the release notes.

The original app with instructions on how to set it up can be found here: https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/adb-root-scoop-catch-stack-trace-app-t3888798

The instructions for this fork are the same, with one difference:
 - If you're unrooted or using ADB, type `taco.scoop` instead of `xyz.paphonb.scoop` for the command.


#### Bugs

If the app itself crashes, please open an issue and post the crashlog :) (in full spirit of irony, the app will catch its own crashlog as long as you did the initial setup).
