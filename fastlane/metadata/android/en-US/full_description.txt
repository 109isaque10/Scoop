Scoop catches and saves the stack traces of crashing apps and displays all crashes in a list so you don't have to look through annoyingly long logcats anymore.

Extremely useful for app debugging.

Scoop supports both rooted and non-rooted devices (though non-rooted devices require some setup; see the repository wiki for details).

Features:
- Search (apps, stack traces)
- Crash preview in notifications (configurable in settings)
- Combination of the same crashes / apps to avoid repetitive lists (configurable in settings)
- App blacklist
- Quick actions in notifications to copy / share stack traces
- Dogbin upload support for convenient sharing
